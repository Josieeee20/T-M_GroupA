Function call:
stylo()

Depending on your chosen options, some results should have been written
into a few files; you should be able to find them in your current
(working) directory. Usually, these include a list of words/features
used to build a table of frequencies, the table itself, a file containing
recent configuration, etc.

Advanced users: you can pipe the results to a variable, e.g.:
	 my.discovery = stylo()
this will create a class "my.discovery" containing some presumably
interesting stuff. The class created, you can type, e.g.:
	 summary(my.discovery)
to see which variables are stored there and how to use them.
